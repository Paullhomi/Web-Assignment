    <p>
        During this module, I have learned the uses of HTML and CSS and how
        to make  and style a responsive website. and also i  understand
        HTML tags such as header, nav, main, and footer.Learning this module 
        was challenging but with the help of my tutor it became easy and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <p>
        I used CSS Grid to design the project page layout and media queries to
        ensure responsiveness on mobile devices. One challenge I faced was
        aligning content correctly across different screen sizes, which I solved
        by using flexible units and grid layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
        The design decisions included using simple colors, readable fonts, and
        a consistent navigation bar across all pages. this website shows the 
        proggress and effort i have put in this module.
